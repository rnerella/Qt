# Qt Class Generator

The default Qt Creator's class generator (Add New -> C++ Class) wizard has very limited configuration options. 

This little utility has got many options like:
  * Namespace name
  * Member variable additions including setter, getter and Q_PROPERTY options
  * Auto generate file name
  * Option to generate CPP / Implementation file
  * ..
